  <p>
    Rolihlahla Mandela was born into the Madiba clan in the village of Mvezo, in
    the Eastern Cape, on 18 July 1918. His mother was Nonqaphi Nosekeni and his
    father was Nkosi Mphakanyiswa Gadla Mandela, principal counsellor to the
    Acting King of the Thembu people, Jongintaba Dalindyebo. In 1930, when he
    was 12 years old, his father died and the young Rolihlahla became a ward of
    Jongintaba at the Great Place in Mqhekezweni1.
    <br />
    <br />
    Hearing the elders‚Äô stories of his ancestors‚Äô valour during the wars of
    resistance, he dreamed also of making his own contribution to the freedom
    struggle of his people.
